# Summary

As a mechanical engineer, I have been doing research into aeroponics systems (soilless agriculture). As I did research, I found that one of the biggest expenses are the nozzles utilized in these systems (close to $30 a piece!). So to cut down on cost, I threw the CAD files together and printed (including the threads). They work perfectly! Figured I would share for others who are running into similar issues.


Both nozzles (Flat and full cone) are 1/4" NPT.
